TRANSCRIPTIONS = "Speaker A: Hello there, Kim. Hi there, Kim. It's just Harry calling from safe life solution. How are you today?\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, fine, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Good news. Reason for the call? We're currently speaking to homeowners across the UK. Just making people aware, Kim, you can receive some money from your current property. Now, I'm assuming you've come across or you've heard about equitivities previously.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. So the reason we're calling is over the past 1218 months, there's been some significant changes to equitable east, Kim. Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: Right.\n\nSpeaker A: We're just making people aware about what's really changed and why. It's just growing much more popular and you've seen it all the time. And for example, the adverts on tv as they just come to light, is beneficial for a lot more for people over the age of 55. Now, Kim, what's your kind of knowledge on it? Do you know how it works? Know much about it?\n\nSpeaker B: Not a lot, no.\n\nSpeaker A: That's fine. Have you seen the adverts on tv or is it not really something you saw either?\n\nSpeaker B: My mother in law done it years ago.\n\nSpeaker A: Right, okay. Well, as I say, since probably that's happened, it has changed quite a lot since then. To be fair, the FCA have got involved with it. Do you know who the FCA are?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker A: The Financial Conduct Authority who like, run the banks.\n\nSpeaker C: All right.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: They stepped in in equity release about 18 months ago and they've made a few significant changes towards it. Okay. It's now benefiting more and more people over the age of 55. Now, interest rates for equity release recently have just fallen to an all time low and they're as low as starting off as low as 2.6% at the moment, Kim. Okay, now, in a nutshell, equity release is a way for you to unlock a bit of value out of your property. And you can do it a few edge, you can do it as a pension, top up as a lump sum. Either way, it's to make your lady life more comfortable and more enjoyable. Okay. Now, the average person at the moment is releasing from around 30 to around 70,000. Obviously, it all depends on your situation and what you can release. But two of the main things what have changed is regardless now of what you take. Sorry about that. You always own the full ownership of your property and it's not anything that you actually have to pay back at any point in your lifetime. Usually the way the money is paid back is when the last person on the deed of the property isn't here anymore and the sale of the property is completed by whoever you're leaving it to. Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Now, in regards to equity release, at the moment, as I say, what the FCA have done is interest rates have recently dropped to an all time low, and they're at something now called a fixed term for life. So you always know exactly what interest rate you're looking at all the way through your lifetime.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: You have a lot of flexibility within it as well. Now, Kim, in regards to, you can pay the interest as and when as you want to pay it. And if you never wanted to pay it, you can literally just let it run up until the sad day comes where you're not here or you go into residential care. Okay. Right now, to see what you can release from your property. Kim, are you still living at 99 ravens way po two two nine es?\n\nSpeaker B: I am.\n\nSpeaker A: And is that mortgage paid off? Is it still running?\n\nSpeaker B: No, mortgage free.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. And is it just yourself on the property?\n\nSpeaker B: It is.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. And if you don't mind me asking, Kim, how old are you at the moment?\n\nSpeaker B: I'll be 63 this year.\n\nSpeaker A: 63 this year. So what that means for yourself is you can lease. What? Saying that, what's the rough value of your property? What would you say it was?\n\nSpeaker B: What? The value of my property?\n\nSpeaker A: If you was to sell it, what do you think you'd get for it?\n\nSpeaker B: Two and a half.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. That's what it says roughly online as well. So if you get 250 for it, and you're 63 years of age, it means you can release a minimum of 10,000 pound, Kim, all the way up to 80,000. Now, I'm not suggesting go and take all that 80,000 out. It's worth doing what you can and you can't do, and what kind of interest rates you're looking at, and just seeing if any of this money can kind of be beneficial to you.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Now, in regards to yourself, what we do as a company, Kim, is see if it's something that you do actually qualify to do in regards to your property in your situation. And then if it isn't and you think it can be beneficial and you want to hear more information about it without having any cost or signing up to anything, we can actually get a call back arranged for you with an advisor, where an advisor can ring you up and just go through different kind of information with you about equity release and just about your situation, about what interest rates you could be looking at. Just different facts, figures, projections of what you could owe after five years, and just seeing how it works for yourself and just seeing for yourself if it can be beneficial for you. It's good to know you can release up to 80,000 as much as you want.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Now, in regards to yourself. So it's just you on the deed, is it?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. You're 63 years of age at the moment. That's okay. And in regards to yourself, just to confirm for you the average value as well. That's fine. What is your property made up of? So what's the construction? Is it standard? Is it bricks, mortar bricks? Is it a pitched roof? Yeah. It's not fly, is it? No. That's fine. With yourself as well, is it leasehold? Freehold.\n\nSpeaker B: Freehold.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. That's fine. In regards to yourself as well, this property, is it in a trust or anything like that?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. That's fine. In regards to yourself as well. Just to confirm, have you got any solar panels on the property at all?\n\nSpeaker B: Yes, I have.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah. That's fine. Are they yours?\n\nSpeaker B: Will be when I paid for them.\n\nSpeaker A: Right. In regard to yourself as well. And that's something else you could use equitivities for, maybe to get them paid off. As I say, you can use this as and how, as you need it with yourself as well. Just with your properties. It joined onto any commercial properties, any business properties. Are you running a business at all from your property?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. Now, a bit more of an interesting question for you. If you was to look at equity release now, as I say, I'm not saying this, by the way, to go and take all that money out, but is there anything you'd specifically use equity release money for? Would it be a case of general living or.\n\nSpeaker B: A bit of that and a bit of something else?\n\nSpeaker A: Probably, yeah. Good news. So would you use it, for example, to pay, like, your solar panels off? Yeah, that's fine. And a bit just to jump general living, comfortable living, maybe a few holidays, buy a few things.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Fantastic. So it does seem like it can be of use, too. Yeah. Now, as I say, what we do as a company is work alongside a company called key equity release. I don't know if you've seen their adverts or anything on tv.\n\nSpeaker B: Think I have, yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: They're all over there at the moment. As I say, they're not there to sell you equitably, they're not there to get you to take it out. What they're there to do is help. They've helped over probably a million people, decide whether equity release is a good option for them or not. And as I say, the process, what it would be, as I say, you do qualify. From our side, it does seem like you are able to receive more information on. So what we would do for in a moment, is pass you over to our colleagues at key equity release. They won't be signing you up to anything over the phone. They won't be trying to sell it to you over the phone. All they'd be doing is just making sure the details that I've given them are all okay. In regards to making sure the person I'm saying it is is you. What they'll then do for you is just arrange for a callback where an advisor can ring you up, go through different kind of facts, figures, quotations, projections of what you could owe. It's a chance for you to ask them questions, just a chance to get more information, know exactly what the ins and outs of it, what they'll then do. If it's something obviously that you want to hear more about, after they. After you call back with their advisor, what they'll then do is send all that information out to you. And I think you go to, like, six or twelve months to decide whether equity release is a good option or not. If it's not, walk away from it. You don't have to pay anything as, say, you're not signed up to anything. And if you want, you go and take the money out. You go and enjoy yourself. You get your things paid off and live a bit more comfortable. Okay, so you hear a ring in a beef in a moment, just to confirm, what's your date of birth, Kim?\n\nSpeaker B: 19Th. For the 10th. 50.\n\nSpeaker A: 819 58. Fantastic. That's fine. And have you got an email address at all? No, that's fine. Don't worry. That's okay. A lot of people don't have them. Value profits around 250. That should be all. Okay. So you'll hear a ring and a beep in a moment.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: As I say, I'll just introduce yourself so you're not repeating yourself. Loads. And as I say, they'll just confirm a few of the details. And then, as I say, they'll just get you a consultation booked in for you. All right?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A: Can you hear that one? Going to beep.\n\nSpeaker B: Should be doing it. There we go. Now I can.\n\nSpeaker A: There we go. So I'd say I'll introduce yourself.\n\nSpeaker B: Lovely.\n\nSpeaker C: Hi, there. You're free to summit key. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker A: Hi, Sam, it's just Harry from direct media.\n\nSpeaker C: Hi, you're right.\n\nSpeaker A: I submit the web form of Mrs. Kim Sunderland.\n\nSpeaker C: Sure. Bear with us. Have a look what was the name?\n\nSpeaker A: Sorry, Mrs. Kim Sunderland.\n\nSpeaker C: Yeah, there we go. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's right. She just wants to book in for a consultation with an advisor she wants to use equitably. She just use it for general living, pay off a few things. She just wants to hear a bit more about it. All right, sure.\n\nSpeaker C: Bear with me. Yep, sure, that's fine. Is there any mortgage or anything on there?\n\nSpeaker A: No mortgage remaining?\n\nSpeaker C: No, brilliant. No problem. Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker A: No worries. Are you there, Kim? Yeah, I'll pop you through now.\n\nSpeaker B: Lovely, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Lovely.\n\nSpeaker C: Hi there, Mrs. Sunderland. See you through to. So, I believe you want to look into equity release, is that right? Yeah, sure, no problem. So what we do, we arrange for you to speak to an advisor and there's no cost or obligation to that, it's just purely so you can find out all the details and see if it's going to be the best possible option for you. So, yes, all I'll need to do is go for a few quick questions to make sure the property does qualify and we can get that all arranged for you.\n\nSpeaker B: That's all right.\n\nSpeaker C: Brilliant. So, first of all, can I take your full name, including any middle names.\n\nSpeaker B: Mrs. Kim Anne Thunderland alien.\n\nSpeaker C: Is it Anne with an a or without?\n\nSpeaker B: Without.\n\nSpeaker C: Brilliant. That's no problem there. And is it 99 Ravens Way?\n\nSpeaker B: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker C: Brilliant. And is that your main residence?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker C: There we go. And we've got your mobile number here. Have you got a landline?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah. 124-327-6829 brilliant, thank you.\n\nSpeaker C: And do you have an email address? No problem at all. There we go. And we've got your date of birth, the 19th. For the 10th. 58.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker C: Fantastic. And could I also take your marital status?\n\nSpeaker B: I'm not married.\n\nSpeaker C: No problem. Brilliant. Is it just you on the deeds, then?\n\nSpeaker B: Sorry?\n\nSpeaker C: Is it just you on the deeds to the property? Yeah, fine. That's fine, then. No problem there. So that's all the personal details. So it's just a few around the property. So we've got the value here. Is it around about 250?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker C: Brilliant. And no outstanding mortgage or secured loans?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker C: Fantastic. And is the property in a trust at all?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker C: Brilliant. Is it a house or a bungalow?\n\nSpeaker B: It's an end of terrace.\n\nSpeaker C: End of terrace. Brilliant. Brilliant. And is that a bricks construction?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker C: Fantastic. On the roof, are there any solar panels or flat roof? There are.\n\nSpeaker B: Sorry?\n\nSpeaker C: Yeah. Are these solar panels, are they owned or leased?\n\nSpeaker B: Well, they will be if I paid them off.\n\nSpeaker C: No problem. So it is no problem. You can do that. The advisor will need to know about the sort of lease with that though, for now, just because it can affect the resellability. But if you pay it off with the actual lease, obviously that won't be an issue. And are there any business or agricultural ties to the property?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker C: Fantastic. I've just done a really quick check of the area as well. Looks absolutely fine. It's very much residential, isn't it? From what I can see there, that's fine. And is it freehold or leasehold?\n\nSpeaker B: Freehold.\n\nSpeaker C: Perfect. And lastly, as far as you're aware, has it ever been owned by the local council? Oh, don't think so, no, that's absolutely fine. So that's all my questions, so I'm just going to send that through to qualify now. So just to let you know, it is coming back as well with key. We've got over 20 years of experience and we are one of the market leaders, so we're very trusted in the industry and we're also fully regulated as well by the Financial Conduct Authority and a founding member of the equity release council. So you've got all sorts of guarantees just to make sure it's all safe and fair for you, really. All right, yeah. And there we go. So it's just come back and qualified. It's qualified for the own brand product as well. So what that means is with every other company in the UK, if you actually went ahead of a plan, they would charge you a standard device fee of around about 1500 pound. But we've grown that much that we charge the provider a commission instead. So there's nothing to pay fee whatsoever. All right.\n\nSpeaker B: Right.\n\nSpeaker C: We'll be coming back and qualifying. I can have a look on the diaries for you. Are there any times that will tend to be best for you?\n\nSpeaker B: Midish. Morning, probably, yeah, sure.\n\nSpeaker C: That's absolutely fine. Let's have a look. We've got a few advisors in the area, so all the appointments, they are being done over the phone at the minute due to the coronavirus, but with that we can also guarantee that all the advisors have been fully trained over the phone. So it'll be the exact same level of service. It's just that we're sort of working around it, but yeah, so that's absolutely fine. We could do 11:00 on Wednesday if that had been good.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, this Wednesday? Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker C: Fantastic. I'll get it booked in then. So it's with a gentleman called Stephen Lucas. He's very experienced, so any questions you've got, he'll be able to answer you'll get a notification through the post, although it's unlikely it'll arrive before Wednesday. But he'll just have the time, date and advisor on there. And it'll have a black and white that it's all of no cost and obligation as well. It can last anywhere up to an hour. Depends on the amount of questions, really. But you can always feel free to have anyone there as well. And do you want to take our free phone number just in case you need to get in touch at all?\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah, can do.\n\nSpeaker C: Sure. It's 800.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker C: Nine 5395-374-3743 my name is Sam. You can always feel free to ask me if you do need anything, but it'll be Steven calling you on Wednesday at eleven. All right.\n\nSpeaker B: Lovely.\n\nSpeaker C: Fantastic. Is there anything else can help you with for now?\n\nSpeaker B: No, that's it.\n\nSpeaker C: Brilliant. I wish you all the best of it then. Hope it all goes well. Cheers.\n\nSpeaker B: Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker C: Thank you. Bye.\n\n"
